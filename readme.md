# Open-Set Text Recognition via Shape-Awareness Visual Reconstruction

The code repo for ICDAR 2023 paper: Open-Set Text Recognition via Shape-Awareness Visual Reconstruction

Working in progress. Will be ready and documented before the conference.

Like is there a site where I can share the ~1.0Gib weights without asking for my phone number?
