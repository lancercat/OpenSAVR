# Open-Set Text Recognition via Shape-Awareness Visual Reconstruction

The code repo for ICDAR 2023 paper: Open-Set Text Recognition via Shape-Awareness Visual Reconstruction

Working in progress. Will be ready and documented before the conference.


[UPD] I will host it here for 30 days...

[UPD] The link is long gone, The cat is currently working on finding a new sharing site where everyone can download without having to pay, register, or installing nonsense shenanigans. 
I will make sure to upload it to my google drive should I fail to find one before ICDAR 23 starts.

### Dear community, is there a site where I can share the ~1.0Gib weights without providing my phone number?
